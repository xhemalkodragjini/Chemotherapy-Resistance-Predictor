# Predicting Chemotherapy Resistance from Proteomics using Attention mechanism
Final Project for the course: Integrative Data Analysis at Freie Universit√§t Berlin


#### Problem: Some cancer types are resistant to standard chemotherapy

#### Solution: Train an attention-based network to analyse protein expression in cells and biological pathways to detect resistance
