# Predicting Chemotherapy Resistance from Proteomics using Attention mechanism
Final Project for the course: Integrative Data Analysis at Freie Universität Berlin
-----------------------------------------------

#### Problem: 
#### Some cancer types are resistant to standard chemotherapy

#### Solution: 
#### Train an attention-based network to analyse protein expression in cells and biological pathways to detect resistance
