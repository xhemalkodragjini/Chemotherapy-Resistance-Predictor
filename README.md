# ðŸ§¬ Chemotherapy Resistance Predictor

ðŸŽ“ Final project for the **Integrative Data Analysis** course at Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin.

## ðŸ§  Overview

This project leverages **multi-head attention mechanisms** â€” inspired by Transformer architecturesâ€”to predict whether a patient will be resistant or sensitive to chemotherapy, using **proteomics data** as input.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset consists of **proteomic profiles of patients**, annotated with their response to chemotherapy (resistant or sensitive). Preprocessing steps include:

- Normalization
- Label encoding
- Train/test split

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

- Input: Protein expression vectors
- Layers:
  - Multi-Head Self-Attention
  - Fully connected layers
  - Dropout layers
  - Output layer with sigmoid activation
- Loss: Binary Cross Entropy
- Optimizer: Adam

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

Training and evaluation metrics including accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix are visualized in the notebook.
